Constant-acceleration motion problems

variables: a, x, t, vi, vf
a, x, and t pertain to the process (and hence use the word "while"), unless x = 0, in which case we say "x ends at starting position".
vi at beginning: "... starts at ___ m/s before"
vf at end: " before reaching ____ m/s"
vi and vf are past and future, respectively, so that vi takes "before" afterwards, if something follows, whereas vf takes "after" in this circumstance.

1: appears first (after noun)
2: mid/end-sentence
3: end-sentence

a (present):
1) accelerates/changes velocity at ___ m/s/s
2) while accelerating/changing velocity at ___ m/s/s/.

x (present):
1) moves ___ m forwards/backwards (ends at starting position)
2) while moving ___ m forwards/backwards (ending at starting position)
or for ___ m forwards/backwards

t (present):
1) moves for ____ s
2) for ___ s or while ___ s elapses

vi (past):
1) starts forwards/backwards at ___ m/s before
2) after starting forwards/backwards at ____ m/s and then

vf (future):
1) reaches ____ m/s (forwards/backwards) after
2) before reaching ____ m/s (forwards/backwards) after

what works:
a1 followed by anything2 (or vf3)
x1 ""
t1 nothing
vi1
